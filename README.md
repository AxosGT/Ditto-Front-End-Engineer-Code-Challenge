# Eyewear Code Challenge
A simple application built as part of a coding challenge.

### Running the project locally

The application uses [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for its build process. Clone the repository locally and run `npm install` followed by `npm start` to launch the app at `http://localhost:3000/`.
